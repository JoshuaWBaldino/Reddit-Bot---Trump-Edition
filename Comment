its pretty hard to argue against the fact that liberals have exemptions for muslims illegal immigrants bill clinton etc. so expect twitter censorship. why should we take their feminism seriously when they clearly dont i decided years ago that id give feminists a fair hearing once they start clamoring for bill clintons head on a stick.update given the usual hrhrhr what about censorship on td posts ill make my down thread comments more prominent for the moronsgt no different from rhillaryclinton and rsandersforpresident all honest about what theyre about. we have no beef with rhillaryclinton and rsandersforpresident over their censorship just as we dont care that dick pics get censored on rpussy.gtbut when people sign up to twitter they dont get a big fucking neon sign saying this is liberal territory with censorshipbanning double standards and algorithmic manipulation serving a liberal agenda. twitter capitalizes on the false impression that its a free for all platform just as reddit does at the site wide level even though this sub has been singled out for removal from the front page and for algorithmic manipulation and even though this sub isnt allowed so much as to name certain other subs while they can merrily name us.gtleftist ideas wouldnt survive in a completely neutral online environment one without censorship algorithmic manipulation etc. they need the jackbooted tactics. to try to legitimize their ideas they need to pretend controlled territory is neutral territory

i think it should be more of a personalized brick segment. what if multiple segments of the wall had different things for them. like make different segments different tourist destinations basically.theres so much a wall can and will bring. i believe the area in the united states around the wall that currently consists of nothing will be built up simply because of the wall. no fear of immigrants running across and crime running rampant. and the wall will be a tourist destination.

when hillary says shes against fake news what shes really saying is that shes against the 1st amendment. that if she had the ability to control all news outlets or shut them out entirely rather than just the msm outlets that then she would have won the election. make no mistake shes deceptively but openly claiming to be against the constitution. lets call a turd a turd.

and this is why the msm is terrified of people like milo. theyve gone out of their way reportedly spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to try and ruin his reputation but all he has to do to destroy their narrative is upload a video thatll be watched by all of his fans. it isnt like the past where the media controlled everything theyre losing more control everyday and now that the president in the white house doesnt have their backs anymore theyre getting increasingly desperate. itll be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few years. will they carry on as they are with their influence slowly fading away or will they go back to their roots with real journalism and integrity i really doubt itll be the latter but well see.
very smart move. this will allow her to attract the voters who are scared of the national front racist past.goes back to hacking the french elections

thank you. i have four grandchildren who stay with me frequently all under the age of ten.two of them a six year old and 9 year old wake up early so that we can watch the news together. it amazes me that theyd rather watch news vs. cartoons. we sit and talk about all sorts of issues especially political and its amazing some of the observations that come from these adolescents. i realize that im biased towards them but they are smart as hell and are sponges wanting to learn as much as possible.id encourage people to sit with your children and flip channels so that you can discuss how same news stories are covered completely different especially fox vs. most other msm channels. critical thinking ability is not taught in schools to the extent it should.good post. thanks.

rthedonald rpolitics and rsandersforpresident may quarrel over plenty of issues but im glad that we can all basically agree about hillary.
megyn thought she could be the woman who brought down donald trump and it would catapult her to barbara walters like status. she even timed the release of her anti trump book for right after the election because she thought trump was going to lose badly. instead trump won in an electoral college landslide and made megyn look like the bimbo she is. i still chuckle when i remember the look on megyns face on election night when ohio was called for trump. megyn looked like she wanted to throw up.

in my opinion this could cause a meltdown that makes previous reddit meltdowns look tame. its a fundamental part of running a forum that you do not edit posts. you can ban the user delete the post you can append to the post you can ask them to edit under threat of the other three or clearly redact a portion of the text but you do not ever edit a users post to change its meaning in a non transparent way. its actually a big deal.

was this in regards to his supporters harrassing people or just harrassment in general because as we are all aware the current stories about trump supporters harrassing people in these protests were disproven.this sounds to me like the left is losing control of their protestors and theyre trying to pin the violence on trump. yeah fuck no those are your people out there.trumpers are at home watching this shitstorm unfold with a nice buttery bowl of popcorn. our form of protest was casting a vote for trump we are done here.
this without a doubt proves the legitimacy of these leaks. and that is the most important thing here. no longer just hacks with no proof. quotes on tape from hillary herself. blow this video up.
the only thing that could possibly stop her at this point is a tape of her dropping an n bomb.

this whole thing stinks... we are clearly being told only half the truth. but i dont know...on one hand some people say this is business as usual it isnt on the other hand theres mike cernovich already saying the deep state has full control and is maneuvering trump towards world war 3 i really doubt this... the truth as usual is probably somewhere in the middle. this wasnt a simple case of he lied to pence nor does the fact that spicer used the word crimea in the press conference mean that were heading towards ww3. i honestly think the deep state simply outmaneuvered trump for the first time and managed to remove a valuable team member from trumps inner circle. for obvious reasons the official report cant say that so we got fed the russian calllie spin instead. so no trump admin is not compromised this is just a reminder of the kind of powerful enemies were dealing with. people taking this at face value are being naive something nasty happened behind the scenes hopefully trump team regroups and moves forward. edit also if this comment makes it to front page just let me say dont hate on cernovich just because he sounds crazy right now... theres a reason why hes so upset with this and i think i know why general flynn or his son more likely was cernovichs contact in the white house. from the juicy scoops he has been able to get from time to time its pretty safe to say that mike indeed did have someone inside the trump admin feeding him high quality information on a semi regular basis and i always had the gut feeling that it was micheal flynn jr. lo and behold as soon as gen. flynn is made to resign cernovich loses his mind and starts seeing patterns that to him indicate that were approaching ww3 and that the deep state has full control of trump. to us it sounds silly of course but to a journalist who just lost his only access to the white house it makes sense. so take whatever cernovich says in the next few days with a grain of salt he had a horse in the race and that horse just got taken out... unfortunately.

that should be made very very public. end this islam is a religion of peace nonsense. everyone should know that the quran calls for our demise. if anyone argues that the bible says crazy stuff tell them it doesnt say kill non followers in the name of the lord.edit since there actually are quotes in the bible calling for killing non followers a better argument suggested by poliphilosophy is saying the church has gone through a reformation and allows reformation.

patriots i cant stress enough how much more important the last 12 of this video is even though the title is meant as click bait for the first half and to squash the whole lewdness debate.watch the entire thing that is what we need to focus on in here to get some real media attention. acorn got into the msm. disenfranchising voters is horrific north korean behavior
actually i hope they drag it out even more. this is a zero sum game. when they go down in the publics view djt goes up. but heres the thing these are some very desperate desperatos who are only going down suicide lane because if djt opens their can of worms which he is about to do the result would be existentially catastrophic for the democratic party and msm personally and politically. they all know it starts at the top with b. soerto and hiilary and institutional deep state creeps like brennan hackneyed msm organs like the nyt and works all the way down to the street level to bob creamer the tool who james okeefe eviscerated and who visited the wh like 50 times or something.hillary said it best theyre all gonna hang. and shiffs face has a look of death these days because he knows they got nothing on djt and everything i just wrote above is true. this is gonna make watergate look like night court.its gonna happen. weve passed the point of no return. they tried their insanely best to kill the king but they fucked up. they thought they had czar nick but ended up nick machiavelli instead.
centipedesin addition to the livestreams i also want to point your attention at a fantastic investigative post by uakotehpanda that was unfortunately caught in a filter and maybe missed by some of yourussian oligarchs funding hillaryhttpswww.reddit.comrthedonaldcomments5p1p94getinpedesrussianoligarchmoneygoesstraighttucker carlson interview with little kid who started fire at protest not happy with presidenthttpsyoutu.beqiqallgfmmydeploraball protestshttpswww.youtube.comwatchvxdyh6vvdj0

make him eat them all and then deport him.
it might happen. to my knowledge trump only mentioned soros once at the second debate and when he did he connected soros to hillary. so trumps aware of soros and his ties to the clintons but hardly ever mentions him publicly. this makes me think he plans on going after soros but doesnt want him to know what hes planning.

thats why the dems are now really pushing this voter suppression narrative and how id will suppress all the voters. that are illegal editremember the fraud was essentially institutionalized by adding as many people as possible into each states voter registration database putting the requirement to opt out on the illegal. no illegal is going to bother notifying to opt out. one example was by granting illegals drivers licenses and then by adding all people issued drivers licenses into a states voter registration database.by having all the names of all illegals and legals in the voter registration system now they can go vote. and you can demand a recount and their votes count the same. also forcing them to bring an id doesnt even matter because their id will match with the name in the database.the fraud is having them in the voter registration database to being with. there has to be better quality control within each states database and they should be required to regularly clean up the database and remove illegal aliens and dead people and people that have moved. and the term regularly needs to literally be defined as something like every 12 months or every 30 days or continuous... etc. otherwise dems will interpret regularly as once every 10 years.

hahahaha trump is going to lose the election and his brand will be destroyed and he will lose all his money hahahahaoops
to the fucking top bravo

wow...say goodbye to anymore hollywood work. but great job michael caine
i switched to cnn for five minutes to hear what the cucks were talking about. oh they were just talking shit about melania and ivankas dresses and how shitty trump was dancing. i mean these fucks cant hate themselves anymore right now. their bubble is bursting right before their eyes and they cant handle it. trump is going to be the best president and cnn well be close to closing their doors by the end of the first term.

its wild to think that all these tweets will be a matter of american historical record in the future. like 100 years from now there will be some librarian at the library of congress who will have to be knowledgeable and well read about the tweeting habits of president trump. oh you are searching for presidential tweets containing the phrase pocahontas why yes it seems we have a folder that category what a time guys.

i think youre confused this never happened. neither did the madrid train bombings the london bombings the november paris attacks the belgium airport bombings the nice truck attack or the berlin market truck attack. the 538 people killed 4000 wounded about 3001200 in the past 2 years and countless other traumatized witnesses never existed. dont talk about it. and there havent been a ton of violent islamic attacks like the swedish ikea beheadings that havent been classified properly due to european pc culture. there also havent been dozens of raids of mosques and housing complexes resulting in large caches of rifles grenades and islamic propaganda found. nor has there been any massive increase in child marriages and female genital mutilation ceremonies performed exclusively by muslims. there is no rape or crime problems either everything is fine. again the cologne and european wide sexual assaults on new years 2016 never happened. its perfectly normal and necessary for our survival to take in countless numbers of refugees who arent vetted in any way. also they dont need to be refugees from war or all woman and children. it can be limitless numbers of young men from anywhere in the middle east or africa this is a good thing. the more we welcome less these attacks that never happened wont happenislam seriously embodies peaceful equality and enlightenment. i see more and more woman in the colonialist gross european capitals wearing hijabs and its fucking empowering. children in berlin london and paris are at least 40 muslim now hell yeah this is feminism this is islam this is beautiful marxism this the future of my europe islam welcome

super important e mail in that it demonstrates hillarys poor judgement in the face of influence money and foreshadows how a clinton administration would be indebted to bad actors and criminal regimes.the same issues we discussed mentioned by mook in this email is a veiled reference to moroccos many human rights abuses. her campaign staff is rightly concerned about the optics of the clinton foundationclinton global initiative accepting huge sums of money from a regime that so frequently violates international law and acts in a way that youd expect the clinton foundation to publically rebuke. i guess 12 million is just too much money to allow morals ethics and the best interests and values of american citizens to intervene.bill ended up travelling to morocco with chelsea. hillary ditched the event despite the kingdoms expectation and stipulation re donation that she attend. following the event her judgement and character were eviscerated by normally friendly media outlets httpswww.washingtonpost.compoliticshoping to highlight good works clintons find controversy instead201505055c0a7728 f32f 11e4 b2f3 af5479e6bbddstory.html httpwww.politico.commagazinestory201505clintons morocco 117979. the intercept explores how morocco is exploiting hillarys weakness for huge donations and her desire to be president to support their own geopolitical interests here httpstheintercept.com20150422inside morocco clinton influence campaign

we were a nation of immigrants. those immigrants carved a nation out of nature. they lost life and limb lived hard lives and fought wars to secure this land for their descendants. they wouldnt roll over and give away their hard work to people who care nothing for that sacrifice.they came here when there was no welfare state. they came here when the only offerings were tough jobs and a fresh start. no free schools no free housing no free food no college scholarships no infrastructure to depend on. they came here to build this nation not to carve out slices of it and dismantle it for their own benefit.they came here to be americans and to pass the fruits of their labor on to their children. they didnt build all of this just to hand it away to anyone who shows up.

the obama admin stuck people in detention centers and then ignored the backlog because it was politically inconvenient. democrats allowed this to happen. while its important to uphold our immigration laws its also important to recognize that the obama admin likely ruined the lives of many people by keeping them in legal limbo.under the trump administration these people will get their day in court and those who are actually following the law will be vindicated while those who arent will receive justice in the most humanitarian way possible through a speedy process.trump actually does deserve a nobel peace prize for this. im not just making a joke. he is going to help a ton of people that the obama admin was oppressing while also upholding the law. thats how justice is supposed to work.
political correctness is just a way for the left to get out of examining or defending their beliefs.

this is a shitty bill. even if they were going to do an obamacare lite they need to address health care costs. there are only so many ways to get costs down. they are drastically reduce the amount of administrative work and bureaucracy. create a comprehensive streamlined standard that everyone must use. it should be open source and as simple as it can possibly be and still function files directories filetypes etc. get drug prices down. allow drugs to be approved that have been approved in countries we trust to test properly and offer reciprocation. allow importation of drugs at lower prices. you can also shorten or remove patents to speed up innovation new mechanism for funding will need to be devised reduce defensive medicine. some say tort reform is the solution. that might have a small effect but the better method is to increase communication and transparency between patients and doctors. that is done by allowing patients to more freely choose the doctors they like and for doctors to be more autonomous from hospitals. price transparencies. the cost of a treatment should be up front and transparent both from the hospital and the insurance company. this allows smart shoppers to lower costs. along with price transparency you can add treatment pay caps will only pay up to x for a specific treatment so that consumers can decide if they want to shop around to get under that cap or pay for convenience. take the power away from the state medical boards. their monopoly on granting medical licenses makes costs higher.the fact that this bill doesnt have any of that means its a shit bill that wont get health care costs under control.edit a final point about pre existing conditions and chronically ill people. the only way these people will get affordable coverage is if other people pay for it. some level of government is going to end up paying for the chronically ill or we have to choose to let them die if they cant find charity. i would personally prefer to reform medicaid medicare and the veterans administration into a unified government health care provider. offering the public the ability to buy into this system as a public option would also increase competition in the marketplace that way private insurance cant get any more expensive than the inefficient government run option full of sick people.

they have warped the word racist so hard to make it fit into their narrative that is is no longer an awful thing to be a racist. it used to be hating someone because of their race made you a racist. now acknowledging a difference between the races or winning the superbowl makes you a racist.
this is incredibly important we have to make sure we take delegates away from what kasich and rubio had already earned. if you live in massachusetts get off of your throne and get the hell out to caucus its more important than ever we are inches away from the nomination. trump is currently at 996 delegates yeah.. hes nearly there.

im all but convinced at this point any hillary support on reddit is 100 disingenuous. we arent dumb and reddit isnt some crazy uncontrollable beast. the tone since like march site wide was pretty much fuck hillary. and on a site like this where damning evidence comes out every day and redditors by nature click every fucking link and stay involved and yet somehow some way we are still told every day on this site that hillary is the bomb. where did it come from when did it start its 100 fabricated. its not real and i believe it has to do with what will happen post election. ctr is here to tell us to sit down and shut up after this shit is done being rigged
we are talking about a website that regularly has bill gates posting on a website that had an ama with potus elon musk bernie sanders snoop dogg etc etc....holy shit spez that move catastrophic.imagine for a second that ken bone was a trump supporter. i wonder what we and he would find in his comment history.

its really simple. a lot of us disagree on a lot of things but we all agree on one thing...we will not surrender to the false song of globalism.we can talk about our disagreements with a civil discourse and respect the others opinions. youre not an idiot and shunned for your thoughts and neither am i. there are republicans here there are democrats the hard right and a few borderline socialists. libertarians and the christian right. but we all understand that american exceptionalism isnt an opinion but rather a cold hard fact and the constitution is the single greatest document ever written to govern man on this plane of existence.

soros makes his fortune preying on unstable economies. see asia in the late 90s. he caused their market crashes. but he justifies it by saying if he didnt someone else would have just like when he tagged along with his christian protector confiscating valuables of his jewish neighbors sent to gas chambers see video he tried to erase from the internet. right now he sees germany and italy especially have gotten themselves deeply in debt. deutschbank is on the verge of crumbling. his goal is to make their economies so weak flooding them with burdensome illiterate migrants that he can swoop in and crash eu economies too making billions. this man is the farthest thing possible from being a humanitarian philanthropist. if liberals could pay attention for 1 minute put their emotions aside they could see the big picture.

i heard about this friday night from a friend of my girlfriend who is an attorney with the state but apparently ice agents are showing up to court cases to arrest people who are violating immigration law. the person telling me about it was horrified as is the author of the article but it took all my might not to dance a jig when hearing the news. so i googled it this morning and a local magazine is doing a story on this. look at this fucking amazing logic the idiot criminal apologists are employinggt by using the court system to find and detain immigrants ice is undermining the judicial system and making people fearful of showing up to court for their trials including for things like misdemeanor cases.oh no the illegal immigrants will be afraid of facing the consequences of their additional offences if they may also have to face the consequences of their original crime of breaking in to the country. the horror.gt from a lawyer quoted i want my clients to comply i want them to show up to court i want them to have faith in the system but when ice comes in and monkey wrenches the system its very difficult for people to feel like they can still have faith when they got their legs cut out from under them.sorry dumbfuck but ice showing up to arrest them for breaking the law is the system working properly.i love watching these people get btfo.
surely that would have been the plan if we stayed in also. all that nonsense about it being non binding and thus better for optics if we had stayed in was bullshit.im so glad geotus is on our side.

the reason my bf and i voted for trump was for his stances on healthcare. i watched both my grandparents die from shitty treatment and running out of money and my bf has brain cancer and has literally shelled out close to 80000 for treatment his insurance here in md wouldnt cover. if he had texas bcbs instead of maryland bcbs the majority of his treatment would have been covered. we know because we went there. its not our fault we live in a cuck state. our entire manufacturing business is here.

i dont care if youre left right up down whatever if you have to resort to censorship to get your way youre a piece of shit. period.by the way im a former bernie supporter. i used to think i was a leftist because i thought the left stood for things like freedom of speech diversity of opinion treating everyone fairly standing up for the truth. but the more i learn about them the more i realize holy shit mainstream liberals are completely full of shitim through with liberals because of bullshit like this and liberal elitism and the left wing media bubble and social justice thoughtcrime censorship bullshit and coddling black people like theyre children and treating muslims like they dont have to follow the same laws as everyone else and so many other things only rthedonald has the balls to talk about. everyone is so politically correct and afraid to call the liberal media out on their constant bullshit. theyre still whining about why they lost the election. blaming everyone from comey to whitelash to everything except themselves and their chosen one.i was so sad on election day because i bought into the bullshit liberal media narrative. i 100 thought hillary was going to win and we were going to have to put up with the clintons in the white house again. when trump won pennsylvania it was all over. i couldnt stop laughing the democrats and the liberal media absolutely deserve this loss and it makes me smile every time i think of how badly they lost.
holy shit he said it.

please do not fuck with the customer support staff i work in customer services. this will not do anything except piss off the customer support staff. they already deal with enough shit. please dont make their life worse. instead inquire about the best way to file a formal complaint. you can submit an oral complaint but usually the customer service rep is going to be paraphrasing your complaint eg. customer did not like content on home screen. writing a formal complaint and mailing it in gets more attention and doesnt filter your words. please leave the customer service reps alone. instead try to befriend them and learn more about how to make a bigger impact. find names of managers directors and heads of departments and send them letters directly. edit also its probably better to file the complaint before closing your account. customers have a greater influence over affecting change than non customers.

im from baton rouge. just thought id throw this out therejohn bel edwards thus far is an awful governor who plays the partisan democrat game perfectly. hes a douche whos been in office for less than a year and has already committed 3 or 4 actions worthy of massive amounts of people calling to recall him. this flooding is basically the only thing hes done even a half assed job at as the alton sterling situation was largely handled masterfully might i add by mayor kip holden whos a democrat but a great mayor and sherriff sid gautreaux who also did an awesome job keeping everyone calm and in check.that being said fuck edwards for saying that trump shouldnt be here. for whatever reason the media is suddenly acting like baton rouge is in a complete state of destruction and in shambles when they largely didnt even cover the flooding until after the waters went down and all of our interstates reopened and trump is getting in the way of emergency responders while theyre trying to save lives. thats completely inaccurate. the flood waters have completely receded and baton rouge largely looks normal but the problem is that many people have lost everything and their houses are damaged to the point that they cant be occupied.what helps in these kind of situations media attention. we dont need to be left alone so first responders can save lives at this point we need people across the country to come together and send food donate to charities and churches see the top post in the big flood thread and volunteer their time. the fact that trump came here is awesome for us solely because it gives us the media attention that we so desperately need. donald trump is not blocking anyone from doing their jobs nor is the secret service being here overloading us. thats a bullshit narrative being pushed solely to make trump look badsorry for the wall of text the whole situation is just bothering the hell out of me.

i always notice that the day before the left and the deep state do anything sharia blue goes quiet on reddit as if they are being briefed on strategy that they must follow for a following time schedule.its like a tsunami you can always tell its coming it the tides are receeeding the wave comes it does some damage but it dissipates just as quickly.their goal with this latest event was to put trump in a predicament and considering the nature of whats happening on the td right now the side product is that theyre trying to take advantage of our differentiating view points since the chemical attack was a false flag.my advice lets wait and see how trump plays this out nothing has really happened yet on his part and if his history shows us anything the mans a counter puncher anything that broc soros and the establishment throw at him he adopts and makes his own.i dont like the thought of assad using chemical weapons on his own people anymore than the next guy but to hell with sticking americas metaphorical dick in another sandbox.

this is why msm has started to acknowledge wikileaks. they cant deny it. so they did the risotto recipe and the abe lincoln one and the catholic one. because hillary legitimized the abe lincoln email at the debate. and they are ok with making fun of catholics and the recipe one was benign.if trump is going to release a public statement today regarding the allegations he would be wise to actually literally say nothing about it and only talk wikileaks and his campaign platform. his speech yesterday was fantastic.they need to talk about the content of the emails or her paid speech transcripts. her dream of open borders etc.
there will be no liberal tears there will be no liberals in 2020they will see the light and all board the trumptrain. even the crazy radical feminists and the cucks.trump will heal the nation

one of the best ways to peace is through self sustainability.the coal and iron ore of the upper and lower rhineland was one of the primary aims of boths the wars and the peace settlements that followed each. indeed the it was the struggle for resources in the peace settlements that fueled further conflict. the american oil embargo caused a crisis in japan. reliant on the us for 80 of its oil the japanese were forced to decide between withdrawaling from china negotiating an end to the conflict or going to war to obtain the needed resources elsewhere.

the walking dead is the timeline where hillary won.
this was addressed in the top post but i will outline it here in a sticky to make sure everyone understands.concern trolling is part of rules two and eight. though the post in reference for it is gone concern trolling is essentially posts that are low energy and generally look like im worried the trump tape will ruin trump why did donald have to tweet against the rnc im worried that will hurt him examples provided by udurtylilpigboi they are usually either disruptive or attempt to steer the conversationpost into a negativelow energy discussion in an effort to divide people on topics. thedonald is a high energy dom reddit we do not allow low energy here.if you do have some concerns with sub management or current events for whatever reason please send us a message in modmail rule 8. now go out and maga
we are on the precipice. we can either help president trump to walk us back or allow hillary to push us off.
ok i came here looking for something like this after learning of the recount. i live in pa an while i cannot say i supported trump i am definitely happy he beat that rotten cunt. so to think she is using another rotten cunt to help her steal the election. i cannot sit back an watch that happen. i can go sit and watch a recount though. i have to go to sleep. hopefully when i wake up someone who knows this shit can explain what can i an others do.
i know the campaign lurks here a lot so please readyou can do a foia request to cbp for your own travel history. donald should do this.edit yes the records go back to the late 70s how do i know ive done it before. the records include date time airline flight number aircraft type booking class seat and some other information. from this we can fact check everything was she on the flight what type of aircraft was it what airline from that we can work backwards and look at old photosseat layouts.

ive shared this message before on td i am a manager at a production facility on the east coast that with a majority of workers who are aa. i live in a subdivision that is 30 aa. i used to work in the atlanta area with a workforce that was 95 aa. i assure everyone that the liberals are ignoring the fact that the vast majority of hard working african americans do not believe that open borders is the right policy. the dems are quickly alienating this historically democratic voting block in favor of their left wing pussy hat wearing safe space seeking snowflakes. as soon as president trumps policies start positively affecting their pocketbooks they will be red pilled forever.

you also forgot to mention that theyre fairly racist towards other minority groups and man oh man do they love to harass american women particularly the blonde ones. my cousin is a blonde that lives in an area of the country with a lot of middle eastern people in it she has had to push and fight her way out of situations where arab guys grope her. nightclubs in her area hardly have any women going to them as a result.i really dont get the unhealthy obsession middle eastern and to a smaller extent latino guys have towards blonde women. in my experience the italians and southern europeans are kinda like that as well but it isnt nearly as bad as it is with arabs and middle eastern men. every single blonde ive known who has had to be around a few middle eastern guys has had situations where she had to fear for her safety because the guys were coming on to her way too strong they arent too good at taking rejections either and that is an understatement.all of this makes me feel for the swedes and scandinavians who have to deal with these pervy savages not all middle eastern people but you guys know what i am talking about making life hell for their women. i mean these men the second they get a blonde alone they pounce like wild animals hunting prey. its nothing romantic or suave i mean these guys literally pounce and go after these types of women with full on aggression.i mean seriously i really dont get why arabs and middle eastern people have this unhealthy obsession towards blonde women. its like the second these guys get their hands on a blonde all hell breaks loose is it like some sort of a story in their culture fueling this unhealthy obsession

lets be honest. we know trump has already tapped into the really good shit years ago. hes practically immortal at this point. the truth is he doesnt really sleep any more. doesnt need it. he just goes to his room and plays 15d chess against himself to give the appearance of sleeping so as not to terrify the ferals. the guys a terminator.

as a yuge trump supporter ill just contribute what i know so we can make sure were placing accurate scutiny. the cia contract was awarded to aws amazon web services a couple of years ago before bezos purchased the compost. the compost purchase was from his own pocket and not officially an amazon corporate acquisition. i dont know if thats really an important distinction since bezos is essentially amazon as well but i believe this dynamic will be more important going forward. this wasnt really a conflict at the time of the compost purchase but its something to keep an eye on going forward.

for those who arent fluent in latin quid pro quo basically means if you scratch my back ill scratch yours.hillary attempted to have the fbi re categorize some of her classified emails as unclassified in exchange for some fbi agents receiving lucrative overseas jobs. basically she was confident that the law enforcement agency investigating her would help her cover up her crimes.luckily the fbi declined this offer. however as we know the obama administration corruption extends even to the top of the fbi and they are refusing to call this offer a quid pro quo or even look at prosecuting this additional crime.hillary for prison 2016

ultimately we will discover that islam is taking advantage of the scientology loophole in the moral and legal codes of the western world that allows anything that calls itself a religion. the sharia law components of islam are antithetical to constitutional law especially the establishment clause and equal rights provisions. isnt that ironic they would take advantage of the very law they themselves would reject

as an armenian and a trump supporter i can see this being huge in the states where armenians reside ca nv ma ny. in 2008 clinton said she would recognize the armenian genocide. once she became secretary she blocked the congressional resolution from passing it had the votes but it never made it to the floor.armenians are really angry with hillary about this. she lied to us and flip flopped. only a few will vote for her. there are about 1 1.5 million armenians in the country so this should be very decisive. i would like to add that my entire family and extended family are on the train.
there was an article about a young getting frisked by a female tsa agent a year or two ago. the dad recorded it and went public. i couldnt stomach watching it. it looked like this girl was getting molested. wtf is a little girl or this old woman going to do give me a break. profile and catch the real baddies.
this kind of reporting is exactly why trump wants tort reform for free speech slanderliable. clearly cnn lied and made a false narative there should be no protections for this type of shit. they are no more a news organization than the clinton campaign.

i have to say this everytime this picture comes up.this picture sucks in general. for hiroshima you get an overhead of the bombed city and downtown. for detroit you get an overhead of a baseball stadium and a building outside of downtown... at least show the same point of reference. downtown is getting nicer by the day and i believe every high rise now has an owner that has commited to refurbish the building. total office space leased is the highest in half a century. we have super high hotel rates because they are all book. i would invite everyone to detroit. a beer is on me. to add im originally from the flint area. i would not invite everyone to flint.the only thing i could show you is a dive bar with the best burger ever still make the trip to grab those burgers

unfortunately for us in az there is a long time before the next chance to kick him out. wont stop us from fighting his globalist agenda until then though.

gt he suggested one of the reasons the democrats lost this election cycle was because they did not connect to young people enough and stressed the importance of having a younger candidate in the dnc chair post in order to attract more young voters to the democratic party.god these people have learned nothing how old was bernie and how much support did they have its not about fucking identity politics its about ideas and policy. maybe have a fucking platform that isnt muh racism.

heres an interesting scenario i read on rconspiracy comey and the nsa are working to oust deep state players in the cia. comey has to tread a fine line of looking like hes not working with trump but also not overtly telling any lies.dont know if thats true and to be honest i have no clue what comeys about with all the different actions he takes that seems to benefit different parties at different times. my occams razor instinct is telling me hes just an incompetent in way over his head but trump has 4d chessed us before.

president trump and obama were actually being strategic by not divulging that information. they werent required to do so and its never smart to give your enemies ammunition if you dont have to. hillary is on a whole different level. she was served a subpoena for those emails from congress and she still deleted 33k of them. that alone is a criminal action regardless of all the other stuff they found.

some people asking me what surprised me the most. heres a couple things but the entire book is utterly fantastic. he has a strong narrative voice in his book comical and easy to understand. anyway i think his explanation of the frankfurt school is outstanding. he explains the infiltration of cultural marxism through academia which professors in turn preach to their students. speaking as a graduate teaching assistant about to get her mfa in fine arts yes im an anomaly though i do have two close conservative friends in the program ive read art related articles by the frankfurt school thinkers and of course heard them mentioned time and time again in readings assigned by faculty. i knew i didnt agree with these people but ive never done my own research on how they actually made it into our education system. breitbart outlines this in extreme clarity and with humor as well as their thoughts and principles for anyone unknown to their history. this is necessary reading for anyone wondering how we got to where we are today.also the alinsky tactics section is a must read. he breaks down the tactics of the left to a fucking tee. how theyve used identity politics to control the left and silence the right through the media which he refers to as the opposition party. he then goes on to outline what trump and his administration are doing now all the way down to the power of twitter and social media. he wrote this book in 2011. they are following breitbarts plan and its working. not to mention breitbart believed podesta was directly related to sex trafficking years ago tweeting it on twitter. breitbart teamed up with bannon and now bannon is teaming with trump cracking down on sex trafficking in our country. theyre going to get those fucking sickosi firmly believe we wouldnt be here without breitbarts genius. may that man rest in peace and may we find true justice for his death.

democrats are obsessed with race. donald trump isntwhy does the press hype a white nationalist sideshow of only 275 people it feeds the deplorables narrative.since when does a weekend gathering of nearly 275 white nationalists in a country of more than 320 million people warrant front page coverage in major newspapers since the election of donald trump apparently.the same media outlets that insisted mr. trump wouldnt beat hillary clinton have spent the past two weeks misleading the public about why he did. breathless coverage of a neo nazi sideshow in the nations capitalwhere antiracism protesters almost outnumbered attendees according to the washington posthelps liberals illustrate their preferred basket of deplorables explanation for mrs. clintons loss.the reality is that mr. trump didnt prevail on election day because of fake news stories or voter suppression or ascendant bigotry in america. he won because a lot of people who voted for barack obama in previous elections cast ballots for mr. trump this time. in wisconsin he dominated the mississippi river valley region on the states western border which went for mr. obama in 2012. in ohios trumbull county where the auto industry is a major employer and the population is 89 white mr. obama beat mitt romney 60 to 38. this year trumbull went for mr. trump 51 to 45. iowa went for mr. obama easily in 2008 and 2012 but this year mr. trump won the state by 10 points. either these previous obama supporters are closet racists or theyre voting on other issues.trump switched white voters in key states who were blue collar primarilycoal counties manufacturing counties the republican strategist whit ayres told me this week. these are blue collar whites who voted for barack obama. and thats a very uncomfortable thing to admit by the left. its much easier to say a basket of deplorables elected trump. but im sorry that just does not conform to the data in those states that made a major swing from one party to the other.part of mr. trumps strategy was to turn out lots of republicans who stayed home in 2012 but the president elect appears to have won white voters by a margin similar to that of mr. romney. however mr. trump was able to muster an electoral college majority by taking advantage of lax support for mrs. clinton in the metro areas of large consequential states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin. that the democratic nominee failed to speak to the concerns of obama voters is not the fault of the alt right.trump swept the areas that keep the lights on and the motors turning demographer joel kotkin wrote recently. trump seized on the widespread sense that american life was destined to get worse from generation to generation. americans wanted opportunity for the next generation not a managed decline. the press mostly missed this story because it was so focused on the candidates tone and temperament. what mattered most to the media was mr. trumps character flawsand it was inconceivable that voters would have different priorities.around two thirds of the electorate consistently told pollsters that the country was moving in the wrong direction. mr. trump represented change. millions of people in the nations interior ultimately decided that they didnt have the luxury of obsessing over his personal shortcomings. they havent had a raise in a decade. college is no longer affordable. health care costs were supposed to come down but premiums have risen. mr. trump they decided may be crude and unpolished in manner but he also sounded like someone who could shake things up in washington. by contrast a vote for mrs. clinton was a vote for more of the same.not everyone on the left is blaming racist voters for mrs. clintons defeat. sen. bernie sanders credited mr. trump with understanding the anger and angst and pain that many working class people are feeling and added i come from the white working class and i am deeply humiliated that the democratic party cannot talk to where i came from. its no coincidence that rep. nancy pelosi the house minority leader from san francisco is now facing a leadership challenge from ohio rep. tim ryan who represents areas that flipped from blue to red this year.yet regardless of the facts most liberals and their friends in the media continue to view mr. trumps victory through a self serving racial lens. today race is the democratic partys organizing principle. group identity is a doctrine and group grievances are to be nurtured and exploited politically no matter the damage to civil discourse. its the type of thinking that allows the left to be outraged that the likes of steve bannon have mr. trumps ear and indifferent that the likes of al sharpton have had mr. obamas.

god warned moses of the dangers of moloch and his child sacrificing followers in leviticus commanding them to be driven out of society.if you believe in a higher power i dont think its that far outside the box to think god would intervene against the people who claim to also follow moloch.even the stories of judges tell of men who were inspired by god to fight against the malevolence of the current leaders. most people assume that since trump doesnt behave like jesus that this isnt the case. however many of these men were fighters and had to use force to undue the existing evil.

i gotta say you young centipedes have surprised me. the enthusiasm for trump that i see from you youngsters inspires me. to have endured the leftist dogma that has been preached at you and ruthlessly enforced since the time you set foot in school...fucking bravo critical thinking is a skill that has fallen to the wayside when it comes to educating our young and its a goddamn shame. you young centipedes are the future. you are now and you give me hope when i had almost thought all hope was gone. thank you against all of the odds stacked against you you have become aware. you have taken the red pill and rejected the easy path of the ignorant and the reckless. the path of least resistance. the path that was planned out for you. the easy path of your social justice educators and ignorant peers that sought to push you towards a life where mediocrity is applauded by those who have achieved nothing of their own. and those who frown upon achievement.thank you young centipedes for giving me hope. hope for the future of our country the greatest nation that has ever been. i cannot imagine the pressures that have weighed upon your shoulders. for i myself have felt just the barest touch of what you must have faced the barest touch upon my brow many years ago as i left to enter the real world.i thank you. for having the courage to not only think for yourselves but for also having the foresight to think of the future of our country. forgive me my melodrama. i am but an oldfag that has supped on bitterness and betrayal for far too long. and yet you give me hope.

lets not also forget that bill clinton is a rapist.
just a friendly reminder trump would not want to deport any of these people if they were legal immigrants.why is this such a fucking hard concept to graspprobably because they are wilfully ignorant

overpopulation is the doom of us all stop having children underpopulation is the doom of us all we need to import people who have more children to elaborate on what actually needs to happen people need to be encouraged or at least stop being discouraged from having kids. adopt local if you dont want to go through childbirth no need to catch em all overseas. plenty of kids here need homes. good parents. education needs a complete overhaul to remove the marxist rhetoric plaguing our society. doesnt matter if you have a harem of several concubines popping kids out if 80 get indoctrinated into self loathing suicidal cucks. speaking of harems no more replacement population from migrants. no immigration unless properly vetted no refugees unless they are demonstrably women or children no more welfare queens.
the war was obviously a scam. clinton didnt become a war criminal until syrialibya but she was yet again an enabler of unprincipled violence. trumps ability to call iraq what it was is a strength. he deserves support from the left here.

this is picky but important imo. the constitution grants us nothing. no man government or document can grant rights to us. we have inalienable rights endowed to us by our creator as stated in the declaration of independence. the ability to grant rights belongs to the creator alone therefore no man can take them away. the governments duty is to protect what we already naturally possess as human beings. that is a big difference between our laws and laws of other nations american law is basically founded on the premise that the giver of liberty is the creator not the government.

i agree on the title not on the body. from what i have heard uc berkeley police was specifically ordered to stand down shoved inside to not see what was going on. other officers were being lied to by the college telling them that it was all peaceful and people were just shooting fireworks they were also shoved inside a building. and of course if you disobey the order then your ass is on the line. you could argue that the police should have stood up regardless but i can understand them not wanting to lose their livelihood and put their families in danger.

fort lauderdale jihadi esteban santiago aka aashiq hammad la ilaha illallahthere is no god but allahjihad in americaestaban sanitagos aka aashiq hammad journey to islam goes back at least 10 years. his myspace page is eyeopening. more news the enemedia ignores censors scrubs thanks to charles johnson over got news.as for mental illness that is now the default cover for islam. it was lone wolf until the number of lone wolves made the narrative ridiculous and absurd. now islam is a mental illness.suspect chose florida airport for rampage that killed five fbi santiagohammad chose florida airport for rampage that killed five fbi.breaking fort lauderdale jihad esteban santiago joined myspace as aashiq hammad recorded islamic music...fort lauderdale airport terrorist esteban santiago registered on myspace under the name aashiq hammad and recorded islamic religious music on the site 3 years before he ever deployed to iraq as a u.s. soldier destroying the lying mainstream medias narrative that he was just a mentally disturbed veteran and that islam had nothing to do with it.heres how we know all thata search of public records database nexis reveals that puerto rican esteban santiago has a brother named bryan santiago and two e mails registered to his namethe second e mail naota33hotmail.com is how gotnews exclusively visually identified santiago before every mainstream media outlet and discovered he was posting on an explosivesweapons forum about mass downloading islamic terrorist propaganda videos in 2007 yesterday.today we discovered the first e mail naota017gmail.com in the myspace database that was leaked earlier this year. this is the raw data we found211355052naota017gmail.comaashiqhammad0x313afa5189c150b7b0f3e6d39e0fa223f88ec42b the middle entry aashiqhammad can be added to the myspace url to discover the profile that was registered to the e mail address naota017gmail.com.sure enough esteban santiago registered a myspace account under the name aashiq hammadaashiq hammad lists penuelas puerto rico as his location just like esteban santiagos records in nexis.and take a look at the three songs recorded by aashiq hammad. the first one is titled la ilaha illallah which is arabic for there is no god but allah and the first half of the muslim declaration of faith the shahadahif the location and e mail werent enough proof aashiq hammad also has bryan santiago estebans brother as a connectionthe song la ilaha illallah by aashiq is indeed just an arabic recitation of the muslim declaration of faith there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messenger. we recorded the song and you can download and listen to it for yourself here.why is msm lying to us that fortlauderdale terrorist estebansantiago isnt muslim when he was recording this on his myspace in 2007 pic.twitter.comgcpt4orbsh wesearchr wesearchr january 7 2017 intentional recitation of the shahadah is generally considered sufficient to convert to islam. listen to that song. it sure sounds like esteban santiago was intentional about what he was saying............. and the best partthat song was recorded in 2007 3 years before esteban santiago went to iraq as a u.s. soldier in 2010 destroying the lying mainstream medias narrative that he was a mentally disturbed veteran although even they admit santiago went into an fbi office in 2015 and told agents he was being forced to watch isis videos by voices in his head or something.2007 was also the year that naota33 was posting on an explosivesweapons forum about mass downloading islamic propaganda videos as gotnews exclusively revealed yesterday.santiago was definitely mentally disturbed but if he was calling himself aashiq hammad recording islamic religious music online and downloading islamic terrorist propaganda all in 2007.

lol. nice to see people quoting me for my brilliance.but you should know from where i got such insanely powerful ideas lest people think i dreamt them up myself.you get ideas like this when you read the original supporters of and brave fighters for the tradition of liberty in the west. people like john stewart mill john milton thomas paine thomas jefferson benjamin franklin and so on.heres a good starterhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvjyoofrog1em while im pleased to have the idea attributed to me i believe christopher hitchens quotes from a few great fighters for freedom and liberty in the past who said the same thing.gt freedom of speech is meaningless unless it means the freedom of the person who thinks differently. rosa luxemburg paraphrasegt if all in society were agreed on the truth and beauty and value of one proposition all except one person it would be most important in fact it would become even more important that that one heretic be heard. because we would still benefit from his perhaps outrageous or appalling view. john stewart mill paraphrased by hitchensgt its not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard it is the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear. and every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action. because you deny yourself the right to hear something. in other words your own right to hear and be exposed is at much involved in all these cases as is the right of the other to voice his or her view christopher hitchens summing up thomas paine john stewart mill and john milton.you know just watch the video. he gives a great reading list in that talk regarding this subject.

from what i can tell rock is not considering the run. others want him to. thats because they see trump won only because he is a celebrity. and they think the voting public is stupid and so they would vote for any celebrity. of course we all know the only other celeb that could win is kanye....

what the article fails to mention money being used is from the 100 million trump gave to the state to fix water infrastructure. 3 million out of that 100 was paid in lawyer and administration fees. obama did promise 80million to the state either late 2015 or early 2016 but never allocated the funds. shocking i know.

decent read but it feels like a whitewash.first papers over the severity of the clinton email scandal a doesnt mention things like having her maid print out classified materials or using unsecured blackberries on foreign trips or destroyingmodifiying evidence hammers bleachbit stonetear. b makes claims about not prosecuting being the obvious decision but without substantiation e.g. comey certainly knew that the career prosecutors who had been working hand in glove with the f.b.i. agents would agree with the decision. no support given to back up that claim about the prosecutors.second despite some criticism of comey the story closes by absolving him of any real responsibility or agency as if comey always did what he thought was the right thing and any errors are the result of his dedication to virtue and integrity barfgteven comeys close friends acknowledge that his great strength is also his great weakness a belief in his own integrity. he believes this in a way that creates big blind spots because he substitutes his judgment for the rules says matt miller a former director of public affairs for the d.o.j.

this is the concept of school choice. it is not a death blow to public schools. it is empowering the parents to make the right choice for their family and children. it encourages competition among schools to preform and produce better results so parents want to give them the money. it gives the good public schools better influence than the underpreforming ones. it discourages indoctrination in the school curriculum.of course there would need to be standardized testing to ensure that standards are being met and if they are not then funding would be revoked.
i wonder if the reason people think trump will ruin the country is because the clintons have spent decades putting every little cog exactly where they want it to be. thats what trump will ruin. the status quo.

funnier is that trump was listened to and he didnt do a standard stump speech and instead riffed on new york stuff that was appropriate for the event and audience. el rato cluelessly parroted out his usual political bullshit and nobody cared.being able to know what a crowd wants is important for a politician. ted is just a mess... cant even do politics well.

got an email yesterday that the isu police want to increase security at the event. this seemed totally reasonable and while inconvenient was something i got on board with. student organizers asked for 2 dollar donations to raise the 500 dollars needed to make this happen. then today they asked for another 1500 and the organizers wanted nothing to do with it. they sent out another email today saying that they would not be complying with the additional fee and asked us to share this as much as possible. here are the emails that i receivedhttpimgur.comah7nmv

am i the only one worried that there might be a democrat true believer in the family who care more about the cause than seth i dont know these people or their politics and the fair thing is to presume they just want their family members murderers brought to justice but seeing as how patriotic seth was it seems kind of odd just how far left he was. thats not a bad thing per say and people on the left can love their country but the modern left has gone all in on globalism. seth was clearly more of a nationalist. that explains why he would do right by the american people putting patriotism above party but why would he have gone that far left to begin with a lot of it could be social and generational but what about his upbringing does he have some hardcore democrats in the family people can get crazy over politics.
they already refused to let an old deaf guy show up to be a trump poll watcher at 10th amp oxford this morning. he had all the paperwork and a court order permitting him to be there and they simply refused to let him in. thats already a violation right there. ive been telling you guys. philadelphia is 100 about cheating and committing fraud for democrats. thats what the democratic party has been about in the city for decades. they will have tens of thousands of fake voter registration forms and will bus people round all day. its what they do here. we must catch them and call the police and challenge the votes. those who came before trump were too scared to do that.

i was just reading a book on the bretton woods conference that shaped post wwii global economic policy and it had some interesting admissions. first of all the economic system they eventually ended up instituting was called the new world order economic plan and was first suggested by the nazis. it was based on a paper by german walther funk who was nazi germanys chief economist. in the footnote on page 100 it says if you squint a little you can see an early blueprint for the future economic shape of todays european union.so basically the e.u. with germany as its economic engine was the vision that the nazis had from the very beginning. when the british economist john maynard keynes saw funks plan he was asked to attack it by the british ministry of propaganda. instead he praised it writing in my opinion about three quarters of the passages quoted from the german plan would be quite excellent if the name great britain were substituted for germany. he added if funks plan is to be taken at face value it is excellent and just what we ourselves should be thinking of doing.john maynard keynes would be the chief architect of the post wwii economic system known as the bretton woods system. on page 102 of the book we find the plan that keynes would submit at the conference was he admitted a crude adaptation of the nazi scheme.go read the book yourself the summit bretton woods 1944 by ed conway.my point in all this all these young socialists in america who say that we should abandon americanism and recreate a european style system in the u.s. are singing the praises of an e.u. shaped by the nazis and which came directly from the plan hashed out by walther funk. whats also stunning is that the very same terminology that arose when globalism was first promoted in the u.s. also came from the nazis. the germans were using the terms the new economic order and the new world order plan back in the 1930s.if only these college kids pimping warmed over nazi plans had even a vague consciousness of history and where these terms and ideas actually come from.its significant that a troll can read a hitler speech denouncing capitalism and praising socialism and they all cheer . . . utterly unaware that theyre the very fascists theyre pretending to protect us from. and that the foreign import society they want us to abandon our american heritage for was handed directly to us from walther funk.

why cant other people see how this is what we need in a leaderthere must be a line drawn and no matter the individual sob story brought to the table the answer holds steady. if he wanted to pander and make friends he would say o if they have been here a while they can stay. but trump makes the hard even unpopular decisions. something that obama would get pushed around on cough cough iran trump will not.

2 ic officials close to pence stated privatelyclinton stated privately this monthmy question to assange is how do you know where is your proof i can believe it a lot of folks on here believe it but so what without actual evidence that these people said these things then this doesnt really do anything except get people riled up. i absolutely believe what assange is saying that hillary and the establishment in general would love to have president trump out of the way and pence in the oval office. the problem is that without evidence to back up his claims assange damages the credibility of his claims. its not about whether we believe him its about whether others can be convinced to believe him. if assange has actual evidence of this then he needs to present it. wheres the dump wikileaks promised last weekend something about intercepted merkel conversations where are those
ads dont work anymore because the info people get is now more accurate from independent alternative sources with proof to back it up. project veritas wikileaks among others have exposed the behind the scenes dealings and criminality. this is why they want to give control of the internet to the un which is happening and you have also seen suppression on social media en masse. they know the wall of secrecy is slowly crumbling and they are in panic mode

great interview
why the fuck are our tax dollars being used for mosques in foreign nations
it wasnt meant to pave the way for single payer. its intention was to give the healthcare plan giants like blue cross blue shield more members by forcing americans who werent insured or couldnt find coverage onto their plans. cant afford it no worries the taxpayers will cover the costs. costs rise no worries well transfer the costs onto the patient. obamacare was all about enriching the executives at these top plans by a huge spike in members and by the time the costs got out of control those at the top already made their quick score and parachuted out. obamacare was the biggest cash scam in american history and it came under the sellable guise of healthcare for all. all these government programs are scams behind a disguise. paris climate accord is another one thats coming under a heal the planet save the planet moniker. fuck that its about ...those assholes at the top could care less about the planet. theyll be dead soon fuck the kids.

i think its quite arguable that spez violated several federal and state laws regarding altering electronic communications. specifically i would argue that a solid case can be made out against him for violating the stored communications act 18 usc 2701a2httpswww.law.cornell.eduuscodetext182701gt aoffense.except as provided in subsection c of this section whoevergt 1 intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided orgt 2 intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facilitygt and thereby obtains alters or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system shall be punished as provided in subsection b of this section.his message to us said that his community team is pissed off that he made the changes which implies to me that he intentionally exceeded his authorization else why would they be pissedthe punishment section says up to five years if malicious or a few other things that are unlikely to apply in his case or up to one year for a first offense even if it wasnt found to be malicious.

interesting piece. it was good to hear pollak make that anti pc comment its a certainly a breath of fresh air. this country has been far too concerned about words and feelings for too long. the interviewer dug up one of bannons quotes from what 2011 who actually cares about what he said there it wasnt even damning by any means. people seem to be going out of their way to find things to feel offended about. whats important are the facts which our astonishingly biased and corrupt mainstream media continue to obfuscate and distort as they build their narratives. bannon has hired people like milo yiannopoulos a gay jew as well as raheem kassam a brown skinned muslim to be part of his team. but no lets ignore things like that and keep spouting bullshit about how hes an anti semite and hates anyone who isnt white.i am so glad we elected trump.

not only that in the late 1910s we passed immigration acts that restricted immigration from certain countries that were a threat to us. immigrants from asian countries were heavily restricted and immigrants that were anarchists were deported.people act like its unjust to ban a certain people but importing massive amounts of poverty and uneducated people from crisis zones that are hotbeds of contradictory beliefs is not smart

ive done a lot of reflection over the last few days about what all of this means and i can say that im extremely happy for the outcome and its reverberations all over the word especially in france where that beautiful country has turned into such a dungheap. my only concern is that we take care to not lurch too far to the right. left wing extremists have been and currently are center stage right now and we all should be vigilant against an extreme rubber band effect. i say this as someone whos always been right of center even before the trump phenomenon the cure for left wing extremism is not right wing extremism. im not pointing fingers at anyone not le pen and certainly not trump but there are bad actors out there waiting to seize the moment. i dont know who and and i dont know where.as were all focused on how we can contribute towards making america great again lets just be ever vigilant against those who would ride this wave and co opt it into another monster well end up fighting.

let it be known they have incriminating evidence against hillary clinton and then let nature take its course.
gton july 5th 1998 jorge taborda fled his home country of columbia with his family in fear of persecution. they arrived in miami and have called las cruces nm home for 19 years.if true then they would have been granted asylum. just make that credible fear statement to the first immigration officer and the process starts. its not an easy process but if there is a credible claim its granted. gtweve paid our taxes which is required for us to pay and we have all the documentation up to date said taborda. wrong you dont have documents that showed you entered the us lawfully and are lawfully present in the us. both are criminal acts. gtjefferson is in the u.s. under daca deferred action for childhood arrivals he along with his mother were detained may 9th after leaving their home in separate cars. he was detained for a couple of days and then released. however that was not the case for his mom who he says was deported without being given the chance to talk to a lawyer or her family.the kid is lying about his mother. she had to be ordered removed by an immigration judge which is an administrative proceeding by the eoir of the doj. you can get an attorney if you want but there are no court appointed defenders its not a criminal proceeding those can occur concurrent with ij proceedings. expedited removals only occur at ports of entry for those who are not present in the us in that situation no attorney is necessary but neither is an immigration judge. fucking lying kid. gteverything was a secret they had already made their decision of not letting her go said jefferson who found out about his mothers deportation from another detainee who called to let him know. he says they had asked for his mother to be released for at least a month so she could take care of her assets before being deported but the request was denied.lil bastard is a total liar. she is assigned an alien number a notice to appear in proceedings is generated and served then she appears before an ij for a bond hearing or relief if any or a continuance. she could have just asked to be ordered removed. that is totally up to her. you can look these people up via geo or the contractor that holds them in detention via the a number. gtthe tabordas say they hope sharing their story will get others to persuade the government to change the immigration laws current in place. they say their mother currently has a 10 year ban but are hopeful their family will once again be reunited.yeah well dont violate the laws and if there was a credible fear of persecution it should have been followed by the husband.

do you know if her name is known and if she was reported to her school i dont think i have heard it said any truer than the comment saying they sounded as if they were tired of obama crammed down their throats. it really is that simple. these kids were on the front lines of every single one of his shitty ass policies. and most of them are old enough to remember when things were different and not as bad as now. they know what went on in their own homes and saw there parents struggle. in kid terms they saw birthday and christmas gifts get smaller or non existent. vacations stopped. sports and extracurricular activities got cut. they saw their schools and towns change. they saw businesses close they once went to. they saw parents fight and even break up. they probably saw addiction begin and possibly lost someone during that time. other than personal relationship and significant life events has anyone really been living it up the last 8 years these kids saw crime increase riots wars terrorist attacks racial tension all become an everyday reality to them. i didnt have that when i was growing up. the worse i can remember is the space shuttle crash. your biggest fear wasnt dying from a terrorist attack but dying in a plane crash not caused by terrorist. they are some tough damn kids and we are lucky because we are all going to need them. the true work of fixing this shit will likely end up on their shoulders. we are going to do what parents do and put an end to it. its their job to pick up the pieces and learn from it.

i love the idea of parents teaching their children and at the same time spending time bonding with them but how do we ensure that they are actually teaching them things and not just abusing such a system for a paycheckwould there still be a state administered midterm and final exam who would dictate what is or isnt important for parents to be teaching their children and should they have a right to what if the parent demands to home school their child but is completely illiterate what if the parent can only read at a 9th grade level or is bad at linear equations what boundaries would we put on such a system as to who is or isnt capable of home schooling their children would the parent be required to pass some type of home schooling exam that proves the have a good grasp on the concepts that need to be passed down to our childreni think that all in all this is a good idea but there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered before it could be implemented.

youre missing the point of having an ally like israel. over 90 of the money given to israel is used to buy weapons from the u.s. that means that the 4b in cash to israel isnt lining the streets of tel aviv with gold but is keeping people employed in alabama and other states. in addition the 4b wasnt given to israel without strings attached. israel is required to share the cutting edge military technology that is used to stop attacks from underground gazan tunnel diggers overground rocketsmortarsetc. and terrorist attacks and cyber attacks that the vast majority of american dont even know about.if you think about stuxnet the virus that wiped out the iranian nuclear reactors that was an israeli bit of code that was shared with the u.s. if you want to complain about where the us spends money strategically to keep americans employed and safe there are other places better than complaining about israel. its good to have a friend surrounded by hamas hezbolloh isis and al qaeda to do some of the dirty work. that dirty work is carried out in part by weapons and technology paid for by the u.s. funds.
freedom is back on the menu boys
seriously one of the best foreign leaders you want to back you. putin might be an asshole but he is russia. this bullshit russia vs us is old. russians are badass people and if we want an ally russia should be it. we need peace and if russia and the us worked together the world would be a calm fucking place. im still more afraid of russia and the us nuking eachother than any other war. this bitterness needs to stop and putin found obama too much of a pissy to work with. putin is ex kgb and knows string people. he rose from a spy to the leader of russia. he knows who to work with.

psssssst...... theyre not liberals. they are the ctrl left.
i think this draws a clear distinction between what trump wants to do and what the media is saying he wants to do. this isnt about chunking out mexicans as some goofy race war shit. its about knowing who is coming into our country and keeping the problem people of all races out.
i feel the same way.

trump should fund the underwater basket weaving program directly they do exceptional work
its a last faltering attempt. once trump is in i all but guarantee he will work with russia on extraditing the fucking sith lord for some gulag justice. do not engage with protesters they want a violent conflict. dont give it to em. drink your fill of tears then try to mend fences. we need a united american people to fight soros.

tired of winning
if blacks just knew that all the power they need to succeed brilliantly is just one epiphany away. it is sad that the left keeps them from reaching their dreams by constantly giving them no insensitive to be truly great. here you are oppressed and black take these food stamps and a small shitty apartment and this crap phone. if i were you take all that self defeating bullshit and throw it in the garbage. now come up with a long term plan for success. it is not going to happen over night but it will never happened with a leftist attitude of give me free stuff so i dont have to make anything of myself. now go out there and be somebody you can be proud of.

honestly this election proves they have been replaced by the new media. old media wanted hillary to win so badly that they ignore all the facts on the ground and tried their best to vilify trump so their lackluster candidate could somehow eke out a win. new media looked at the facts did projections talked to actual voters listened to their concerns and looked at both candidates critically. so yes msnbc cnn fox washpo nyt usa today etc their time is over.
and they laughed when he said they would self deport
his name was seth rich is not as powerful a phrase. it requires google and leaves the interpretation up to the googler. bill clinton is a rapist is a killshot. something likednc killed seth rich. this is concise connects the dots and destroys the russia narrative.

or just leave it. its falling apart as planned by obama and his crew. republicans tried but we cant stop bitching at each other because everyone has to try and be the big ole swinging conservative dick in the room. screw it. let the democrat policy fail horribly. itll essentially self repeal.trump said it would be easiest and most politically advantageous to let it just die on its own. he tried. but noooooo god forbid we buckle the fuck down and get to work.

trump can immediately employ 500000 to 1 million american citizens caring for our veterans the truly disabled and patrolling our border with radios to assist the border patrol. instantly patriotic americans both male amp female will immediately have a higher purpose amp a call for the greater good. i pray trumps smart enough to launch an immediate attack upon multi culturalinertia.

guys it is okay to disagree with and hold the god emperor accountable. in fact its healthy and necessary. my overall support is unwavering but that doesnt mean i think he is infallible. i am confident that in the end i will be much happier with the health plan president trump puts his name on than with obamacare.in the meantime its perfectly fine to opposes ryans shitty bill and be vocal about it. if our president is playing his usual 44d texas hold em...then im sure hes counting on us doing just that.

gtfull textlessons learned from the trump treatment in syria 1. if you want to send a message you can send flowers. if you want your message to matter send 59 cruise missiles. 2. if vladimir putin wants his stooge bashir al assad to stay alive he better get him out of damascas and make him eddie snowdens roommate in moscow. they deserve each other. 3. pliant progressives global america haters amp obama apologists are compiling lists of unintended consequences of the u.s. strike on the base putins patsy assad used to launch his latest chemical warfare attack. so what here is some reality a. the moscow tehran damascus troika of terror is close to coming unraveled. other than pyongyang they have no friends that matter. b. if assad goes hezbollah loses their logistics lifeline from tehran through baghdad up the euphrates river valley to lebanon. c. north koreas chubby little despot and his ayatollah allies have to be wondering if their nuke icbm joint venture is worth continuing. d. turkish strongman tayep erdogan has been prancing with putin amp musing about pulling out of nato. the music just stopped. predictionsa. despite our un ambassador nikki haleys eloquence in the mold of jeanne kirkpatrick amp john bolton the russians will do their level best to block any meaningful action in the un security council. b. if the ayatollahs threaten to mine the straits of hormuz amp bab el mandab the houthis in yemen amp irgc naval forces will get the trump treatment. c. if hezbollah gets feisty the israelis will smack them down in lebanon with precision air strikes. d. if president trumps recent meetings with egyptian president al sisi and jordans king abdullah mean anything there will be a sunni arab syria peacekeeping force deployed to syria after isis is driven from their strongholds in raqqa amp mosul. e. last but not least chinese president xi jinping who some say has a heart condition has to be popping cardio pills at mar a lago when he realizes hes sitting down to a bowl of egg drop soup with the guy who just dropped the hammer on bashir al assad. some free advice mr. xi before you decide what to say about trade issues or helping the u.s. with north korean nukes read what your host wrote about fighting back in his book art of the the deal. if i know our president at all theres a copy in your guest room more than likely in mandarin. hes always a gracious host. unless of course you dont understand what hes after. hint putting america first. semper fidelis is more than a slogan for u.s. marines. always faithful is a way of life. sf oln

no answer for him considering that he has no clue what hes talking about why the hell would anyone need an answer for him
and thats not good. because bill clinton is a rapist.
seriously this is how we take back the narrative and how we maga. my friends liberals... are still posting king cheeto memes as well as ranting about how burnt out they are because the horrible things trump is doing just dont stop ...its only been a month since jan 20th and youre burnt out meanwhile im here with you guys... but also working on bettering myself learning new skills polishing up my resume too. were going to maga. make it your personal mission to better yourself in 2017 because they are coming hard for us in 2018. the battle has only begun.
gtbehind scenesno ted. you do not yet understand the power of the memes.
for anyone who hasnt read 1984 you should. it is more relevant to todays society than people could have imagined.
the fact that 224 also triggers liberals to claim racism not just because of low test scores but also because some liberals say that all other numbers would be offended. retards
abso fucking lutely if you are a democrat because you like what democrats are supposed to be about then remain a democrat. you do know though that hillary is not a real democrat. trumps actual policies unlike what the media say his policies are are more in line with democrat principles are over what hillary has actually shown.
im a retired chicago police officer and i can tell you that the feds pay 60 of the cpd budget besides whatever else they pay. with 4000 people shot already in chicago this year plus the city facing bankruptcy decades of dem rule our president will have a yuuuge message to chicago

hold the fuck up you cannot get a ts clearance unless youre a u.s. citizen and even then unless youre a citizen by birth to parents who are also citizens by birth its one hell of a hill to climb to be granted a clearance like that. jesus tap dancing christ what the fuck has the obama administration done to the fbis clearance process president trump needs to get ag court in sessions to unfuck that asap. put me in coach im ready to slay today.
very good point. adjusting with new info is effective in all areas of life really.
nobody wants ryan care. trump already knows its not going to pass. hopefully he uses it as leverage to do an actual repeal.
i agree.
i agree.

jewish centipede here. i can handle the banter but its just not an accommodating environment. td is home.
its the only thing in obummercare worth keeping. everything else is getting scrapped
this sub has been nothing but sr 247 for the past week. there is room here for more than one topic of conversation.we are here for president trump and his policies not a single issue.
you mean like bill clinton seducing a 20 year old white house intern shoving a cigar in her pussy pulling it out putting it in his mouth and saying tastes good jizzing off on her blue dress and in the oval office bathroom sinkhowd that work out for us
just to be clear im not a huge fan of the guy hes former kgb etcetc.that being said hes a strong leader who acts in the best interests of his people and his nation.so he gets my respect.which obutthole does not because he is not.
i was wondering that myselfand bring a friend to the polls too

no questions will be off limits....eh i wouldnt go saying that. if youre going to be a drive by taking shots at his kids his personal life or making baseless accusations of liberal buzzwords youre gonna get stomped.

he can self publish on create space with no upfront costs...as long as his current contract doesnt bar him from doing so. book contracts can be tricky.
retired police officer here no thats not how it works the feds dont step in to deport until the local case is totally finished. so if an illegal commits a robbery or whatever he is arrested tried convicted and serves a prison term. then as he steps out the prison door at the end of his sentence the feds are there to take him into custody and deport him.
ah comical ali. although less comical when you read about how terrified for this life he was at the time.
lets make it happen
little bites
to be fair to collins she voted no too every time. she does have the right to vote no since shes not being a hypocrite like the other two...i wish they can vote present instead of no though. we can afford to lose 4 gop senators if they vote present since that doesnt mean a swing of 2 for the demon rats just a swing of 1 for us. we would still end up with 48 yes 48 no and 4 present...that would still allow pence to break the tie
well a lot of muslims did support hitler...

hey has anyone invited some of these guys to this site can a mod invite bill mitchel and others to join our site instead of always copying there tweets.
heres a stupid game for you to spend lots of time on accomplishing nothing have fun idiots
i just dont see this being allowed unless hillary was dying soon. its not exactly fair to be able to wait until the last few months and then slip someone in who hasnt been dragged through the mud by the media. but then again they are democrats.now that i think about it they would have to come up with new promotional materials advertisements change ballot papers. everything. it would be way too much to do within less than two months. he would be in the race and his supporters wouldnt even have signs or stickers no hats or promotional items. he would have to regurgitate policy ... theres just no chance not this close in the race. theyre stuck with hillary.
anyone who is gay should be offended. this has nothing to do with trump or gays. this is a move to deligitamize our president which shouldnt be ideological. in the words of a famous side of beef. these commies need to be brought to heel.
to the top
i was born in 98 can anyone summarise what happened as far as i know bill stuck a cigar up monicas puy and she blew him got it on her dress which was found. can anyone fill me in but not like bill filled in monica
and he said trump wont build the wall. the trump supporter was wrong on questioning cruz on the second amendment though. cruz has always been a strong supporter of that.
criminal illegal immigrants
its a start at least. they need to expel the eus refugees who are there rightfully as well... just saying.
they need their special health insurance repealed so they can fee their constituents pain.
s4p is a mess folks believe me.
putin hasnt done one fifth of the shit castro has done
yeah but it is a greta poll. i wonder how many voters think that
they are serving cake as we speak
cause 400 immigrants getting jobs out of 164000 sounds like some industrious dudes for sweden.
south africa needs to drop the laws discriminating against white people.
prepare to get redpilled by the tremendous faggot.
i could watch these guys kick ass all day. this is the kind of shit the news needs to be covering.
trump showing what hes signing to the camera...this is the start of a beautiful new meme
no op youre wrongthe usa came here legally president james k polk actually paid for the southwestern territory. if the usa did not intervene france would have taken the that territory without paying like they did with the rest of mexico. it took mexico a miraculous victory on the 5th of may to finally drive the french out

yesterday in his press conference trump said ryan would still be speaker. either trump is misdirecting the media or ryan was in on the plan all along.i think that president trump realized that there was not enough support and not enough good ideas to get a better obamacare replacement in place. so instead he asked ryan to take obamacare tweak it slightly and send it to vote after making it look like we tried to be reasonable. trumps promise to come up with a repeal and replace plan within his first 100 days is met not campaign promise broken. now he gets to say we tried but i cant force people to vote. so now he waits for outcry from both the left and right on obamacare forcing them to revisit repeal and replace but now with bipartisan support and ideas to not only bring us together but also benefit everyone in the nation.i think ryan may have been in on everything and intentionally created a turd bill to fail in cooperation with trump to play a longer game for a real solution.
nobody who has had to live in a muslim country wants islam here and nobody who has lived in a socialist country wants socialism here.the only people who are advocating it have experienced neither ..

theyre not even on it.they can afford to eat cake while the populace scrapes to afford rice.
trump supporters admire trump nude protest art while hillary supporters get violently ill in response to hillary nude protest art. fixed
who needs specifics when you have other peoples money to spendas a brilliant californian political philosopher once saidwe have to pass the bill to know whats in it.
this is the best idea yet. just repeal it. no need to replace anything. then vote on a bill to allow for the ability to sell plans across state lines. that is the most important thing to bring prices down down down. competition.

allah cannot lie but his prophets can. jesus peaceful ways of nonviolence was a trap for humanity and mohamed saved us from much suffering by introducing jihad to defeat judaism and christianity.
hillary and obama directly supported the muslim brotherhood. the egyptian military hates them with a passion.
if colin kaepernick protested with taste and publicly displayed his dissatisfaction by writing about and talking about it on his free time thats perfectly fine. when you put on the uniform of something bigger than you you are expected to represent them without prejudice. so stand for the anthem.

these arent just farming jobs either these are jobs in construction moving kitchen industry and general labor. while immigrant workers constitute 15 percent of the u.s. labor force they are a whopping40 percent of workers without high school diplomas.100 only 12 percent have greater than ahigh school diploma.101 as a consequence the greatest competition occurs among people atthe margins of society a group that includes poorly educated blacks whites and hispanicswho compete against each other and against new immigrants for low wage low skill jobs.httpwww.usccr.govpubsillegimmig10 14 10430pm.pdf

gtthe middle class is in decline. and as it declines so it seems does voting. thats the story of los angeles but perhaps its also the story of the democratic party.gtif democrats want voters to show up and theyve long argued that when more people show up they win they may have to prove to people who have less and less of an economic stake in our society that voting really matters. and to do that theyre going to have to do more than remind everyone that donald trump is in the white house.problem you just had the presidency for 8 years senate for 6 years and house for 4 years. and theyre poorer now than before you started.

how many know that this is how the whole somali pirates thing got started. originally ships were cruising to just off the coast of somalia and dumping waste because the somali govt wasnt doing anything about it for whatever reason. so some well meaning somalis tired of seeing their waters poisoned got some guns got some boats and started going out to the ships dumping stuff and chasing them off. somehow those acts of self protection and self preservation got co opted into actual piracy. sad the original story will probably get lost in time.
i said that and it was abraham lincolns fault.
this is awesome grassroots trumping good for you

its the same story as bill gates coming out and changing his stance on immigration. these globalists havent had a change of heart. they went too fast with their plans. they didnt expect the situation to escalate at the pace it has. europe is burning to the ground way too fast. think of a controlled burn. the controlled burn is out of control and they need to get control back.
this is why i hate illegal immigration. not just because of jobs or sucking away federal money or the drug trade.they are ghosts. they work shit jobs for shit pay taken advantage of like a new form of slavery. i live in colorado i see the way these people live. they have to be miserable.
ive got my popcorn ready.
socialism is slavery.
pau ryan is a turncoat self interested poor excuse for a republican anything. he promised to unite the party which should have been easy having the majorities everywhere instead he has separated them even farther. he needs dealt with.

talking about the problem is a good first step. but it means nothing if we dont individually take action by i rejecting the materialistic and anti family lifestyle liberal society tells us to pursue and instead prioritize ii becoming good family oriented men iii finding ourselves good family oriented women and iv having big families which also means starting early and not using any birth control. if 2 people husband and wife have 10 kids and each of those kids have 10 kids we could easily reverse the trend in a couple of generations.source dad with 6 kids. would be lots more but i didnt find a good family oriented woman until i was almost 30. would have been lots sooner if i had my shit together...

they defend the woman and call trumps tweet like mean girls. so they dont believe in equality and her agency to defend herself. they also support the stereotype of what mean girls portrays. they have no real convictions.

after watching a bunch of white house press briefings my impression of the press is that they are not very bright but particularly invested in the idea that they are doing gods work. there is this sense i get from them and their desire to frame everything to a particular narrative and their obsession with timelines. who knew what when and all that which points towards a belief that again these are not clever people at all. rather they are play acting at a form that seems derived from watching too many episodes of 24. i would add that its possible that they are emulating the west wing or something similar but ive never watched it beyond some terse promos. im guessing that the cia and the bankers or whatever makes up the deep state are similar. the bankers probably love wolf of wall street and wall street and the spies take to jason bourne or john lecarre or james bond and both think themselves too clever by half and again that they are doing gods work. the thing though is that this kind of hijinks is getting old. we have seen those movies too and some of us have studied enough history or followed politics. or alternately kept our eyes open in our own lives and seen enough corruption and short sightedness to get an idea of how the system works. at this point its pretty plain to see the idea that these people have of us that we are are less deserving and certainly less intelligent. the thing is though that we are neither and we see them for what they are and that will be their undoing. also we have a sense of humor. podesta....we got your eeeemails

trump doesnt even need to threaten their medicaid funding as the state will soon be broke from migrant illegal immigrants flooding their state to take advantage of their sanctuary status which is sure to drain their social programs funding very quickly.washington state will have their own mini migrant crisis just as europe is dealing with now after throwing open their borders. give voters a few more years of liberal politicians running their government and chalk up another previously democrat state for trump in 2020.
some contextguy didnt like my cnn meme joke. now hes calling me a racist and that i want to mass deport people.... you cant make this stuff up folks

cheryl millsheather samuelsonphillipe reinesjake sullivanall being represented by beth wilkinson. this joint representation agreement received the required approval from the doj. many legal analysts have said this arrangement is unusual and they are surprised it was allowed. mills and samuelson are also representing hillary clinton.gtby tapping wilkinson the clinton confidants have selected someone with deep ties to washington politics and the doj. the 53 year old wife of former meet the press host david gregory is a clinton donor and democratic contributor according to federal election commission filings. the strategy can also bolster the defense team as a whole allowing the lawyer to gather information from multiple clients to help benefit another legal experts said. wilkinson for instance will get an idea of the fbis line of questioning after her first clients interview which could benefit following witnesses.read more httpwww.politico.comstory201604hillary clinton fbi strategy emails 221435ixzz4atvl0y8k gt the news that hillary clintons closest aides have retained well connected d.c. attorney beth wilkinson to represent them in their boss email scandal is bad news for those that held out some hope that justice would be done in the case. the timing and terms of wilkinsons hiring have clintons fingerprints all over them demonstrating once again that when it comes to corruption and pulling strings to escape the consequences nobody tops the clintons. gt wilkinson left a comfortable sinecure at a prominent d.c. area law firm in january 2016 which likely guaranteed a steady seven figure income to open up an independent boutique white collar defense shop of her own. this is unusual why take such a risk other than for a major political and professional payback from the likely next president more damning in terms of demonstrating that this is clintonesque maneuvering is wilkinsons strange announcement that the new firm will handle her presumably well healed clients on a fixed fee basis. gt on her own though wilkinson can chose to run her fixed fee cases like those of hillarys aides without keeping detailed records of what shes actually been doing with her time. thus in the event there are future accusations of conflict of interest these would be much harder to prove without detailed accounts of wilkinsons activities which she will probably and deliberately not have. and since hillary or a clinton connected organization is likely paying wilkinson and since hillary is in effect wilkinsons real client the fixed fee arrangement was probably part of the deal. httpwww.americanthinker.comarticles201604hillarysfingerprintsonselectionofaideslawyer.htmlixzz4axo8meiu

it isnt super hard. obama administration has done over 2 million and he doesnt even care that much about it. should be easy for trump
lol lets piss off rturkey with this post. i hate him but hes right.
strongly suggests.he cant actually order them to do shit tbh.
trump is president...everrything he tweets is presidential
i cant describe it any other way obama is an enemy of the united states. he is trying to sabotage as much as possible before he leaves.
exactly good man. just go for a straight repeal. the voters will sort out the nays in 2018.
not just the men but the women and the children too.
of course they have or at least someone has. theyve been backed into a corner and are doubling down on the narrative as hard as they can. they want to convince you that maybe trump isnt all hes cracked up to be that maybe the wall wont get built that maybe their accusations are true.as soon as you start to believe them they win. stay strong and maga.

unfortunately term limits the status of their healthcare their pay raises and all of the laws that they dont have to follow are all voted on by them. if trump could get the country to force their representatives to vote on term limits he would hands down be the best president of at least 100 years top 3 of all time for sure. that is the lynchpin if we could get them to vote on that everything else would fall into place.

latin america is not sending their best because the us immigration officials dont want thatthey are more interested in keeping down the prices of labor and other blue collar trades and then using divide and conquer tactics on the american people.i have based friends in mexico colombia peru and panama who are very skilled and financially sound but their visas get rejected because their dipshit countrymen who cant even manage to spell spanish a 100 phonetic language correctly overstay and abuse their entry visas at high rates.latinos absolutely hate political corruption and are ready to drain the fucking swamp when cartels attackedcountryside towns in mexico and colombia and their federal governments were nowhere to be found they formed their own paramilitaries to fight them. it was farmers with their rifles versus cartels armed by fast and furious.rather than try to build governments with savage tribalists in the middle east i truly wish we could have had more assistance to destroy the cartels. those are extremely dangerous fuckers. you will rarely hear latino celebrities speak against them because they will kidnap torture and kill their relatives.i live deep in the us and i changed from an account with my real name because they are that scary.also most productive latinos despise leftismcommunism and have no patience for the so called latinx activists. those are just the ones with abundant time to waste and if they werent desperately loud and obnoxious they wouldnt get their soros money research grants.make america great again

i fucking hate taibbi with a passion.
you know were it not for the cruel and unusual prohibition i really think that a good policy would be to adapt a policy of cutting an ear off of a drug smuggler then deporting him. if he tries again cut the other ear off. if he tries a third time death penalty. makes it very easy to identify known smugglers and they would serve as a visual warning to anybody thinking about doing it.
the feds should be investigating her and all of her potential connections to terrorists. but she was born in brooklyn we cant deport.

my mother came here legally from mexico. for the most part my family has a history that is indicative to that of many hard working families that came here to seek a better life the american dream.the thing i want to stress the most is dont believe the lie poor people dont have to turn to violence and organized crime because muhhh white oppression.i grew up in a rough neighborhood but never understood the tribalism i saw in the streets. growing up in this neighborhood i became best friends with a white kid and a black kid on my block. i saw what all the hispanic and latino kids were getting into and i thought it was all bullshit from a young age.my family fought and drove out the gang from our neighborhood this is a true story. from my experience any kid i knew that had parents that migrated here for a better life were mortified to see their kids turn into cholos. our culture didnt play that snitches get stitches bullshit. if you had a hispanic mom she was quick to beat your ass because our parents didnt come here for us to just shit on the american dream.fast forward 20 some years im now living in los angeles. just about every day i have to drive through korea town to get to my place on the west side. im sick and tired of seeing business owners subjugated to the criminals that are running the neighborhoods with their violence and graffiti.i voted trump after seeing the video of a poor woman getting objects and tomatoes thrown at here by a rabid mob of goons with mexican flags.httpsyoutu.beewxlwrm0rs plain and simple. i got flashbacks of growing up and im sick and tired of seeing los angeles being run by cucks like garcetti. we need law and order in this city.thank you president trump for cracking down on ms 13. please dont stop there. deport everyone that didnt come here legally and everyone that comes here and doesnt respect the laws of our beautiful nation.trump is my homie and so is anyone that supports the movement to regain this country and making it great againmade this graphic and planning on triggering these criminals out here in the streets.

sorry send him not sent him. drinking
i dont believe that its disastrous politically to repeal it. it seems disastrous only because youd suddenly have non stop screaming from the msm that its disastrous. the same msm that has already convinced weak kneed rinos that a repeal would ruin them. but the average american voter hates obamacare. the only people who like it are the ones who actually benefit from it which is not a large group yet and the virtue signallers.whether im right or wrong about that your point is well made. dems paid a huge political price for obamacare. they are still paying it. and we still have obamacare.
what i dont understand are people who know the bill couldnt get enough left senators to vote for it without keeping much of the spending and now they think they can get enough left senators to vote for it to completely get rid of the spending all together. think again

here is the billhttpswww.congress.govbill114th congresshouse bill3762text that passed in 2015 that mcturtle is referring to. the one that president obama vetoed and that republicans constantly claim was a vote to repeal obamacare.it does no such thing. the physical structure of obamacare which is what has utterly damaged our healthcare system is left in place. this was nothing more than a budgetary reconciliation.it only repeals funding and taxes related to obamacare. it does nothing to remove the meat of the bill that has caused the problem.
those people arent insecure. to be insecure you have to have at least some securities in the first place. they dont have any. they care too much about what other people think of them. the only people whose opinions of me i actually care about are the people who i interact with on a daily basis and who i have actually met in person like my family and co workers.

my father was a journalist. i remember discussions he had in the seventies about consolidation in the newspaper and later newspaper tv etc industries. basically that it was bad because it concentrated too much power into too few hands. back then most major cities had 2 daily newspapers. and they were local. not owned by some nationwide firm. tv stations were owned by someone else entirely. i didnt really see the issue at the time but in hindsight i think he was right. these people have too much power. in the end they either destroy themselves which is probably wishful thinking or conservatism gets destroyed one trump leaves office since no one else seems even vaguely up to the task of fighting them.

not to worry. trump is promoting him to va ambassador at large where he will be stationed in various places around the world to teach them how to do medicine correctly. the va ambassador will spend the first year in peshawar pakistan then go to sana yemen for a year. he will have a big american flag uniform to wear at all times to make sure the locals know he isnt to be messed with.

this has been a democratic tactic to ensure future votes for decades past. bring in refugees aliens any and all immigrants. support them for lifetimes on welfare but letting them always think that the dem party is solely responsible for those benefits and never letting them know that taxpayers are funding this not a government party. sure it is happening in europe now follow a strategy that has worked for decades.
i have faith in trump.
i personally would feel a lot safer at the university here in wyoming if i were allowed to have my glock 21. ive been shooting since i was like 5 years old and i know how to be safe with a gun. the only time someone would even know i was concealed carrying would be if god forbid there was a terrorist attack or something. people shouldnt have to choose between education and their second ammendment rights. especially when colleges are often targets for nut jobs.

i dont mind too much actually what they are sayinggt wed better be sure that were prepared to live with the market weve created with repeal said rep. tom mcclintock r calif.. thats going to be called trumpcare. republicans will own that lock stock and barrel and well be judged in the election less than two years away.they are not used to have to actually get things done and make sure they are done right. this is the thinking process in a persons head before they will have to act decisively. i would say its normal after 8 years of obama that they have to reshape some of their thinking. there is a new sheriff in town and they are making normal adjustments.

reminder that she accepted millions in bribes from countries and people that kill like this and continue killing and abusing women. herehttpswww.youtube.comwatchvsnrchlatg5s she talks about changing policies to favor islam. her closest aide huma is muslim with ties to terrorism through her family. hillary plans to radically increase the number of muslim refugees not christian ones entering the us to move in next door to you and watch your kids while youre at work.

id sue the university though good luck winning the case if you get an activist judge
as long as repealing and replacing happens at the same time i am all for this. there will be a big problem if there is any gap in between. people with preexisting conditions could be dropped unless the transition is seamless.

rubio is a cuck he refuses to listen to his constituents. bill nelson is an idiot.
so sad for her that american wont turn out like nicaragua the country her criminal family fled from. maybe she can fuck off back over the open border while its still open.
and hes following trump supporters around and yelling at them now.
they are all scared of even one person losing their obummacare insurance and dying. rightly so the media would crucify them with narratives and interviews and book deals. how trump killed my brother and on and on. i say build a bridge with the four largest. we already pay huge subsidies and open enrollment every month to change policies.

lol very nice
ive been doing that for about a year now. i couldnt stand seeing all those posts about how mr. 13 tax rate and the rapists wife are going to beat trump. it honestly pissed me off because i didnt realize how many cucked friends i had
his hotels have massive brand recognition now. for any customers he lost im sure hes more than making up for it with new customers.
chicago dont worry... it will be a cold day in hell before that guy is elected president lol

i think trump should tread very carefully unless and until we have verified dna proof.this thing being proven false would be exactly the type of thing to fuck some shit up.personally i think this is a non starter. its been floating around forever and has never gained any momentum.if its real full steam ahead.but i have some major doubts and if i am right it could hurt us to lean on this too heavily.folks we have tons of ammunition. lets make sure we are using live rounds. thats all im saying.maga

the look on that kangaroos face after the guy slapped him makes me laugh so much.
basically the narrative is look at how baffled and uncomfortable buzz aldrin looks next to trump talking about space impeach now. meanwhile hes making odd facial gestures and awkward movements the entire length of the video.so im taking this as those manipulative cunts in the msm taking advantage of a possible age related illness as buzz is pushing 90 years old just to hit their trump smear quota of the day.

dont have a twitterhere is the contact page for her consulting grouphttpwww.piersonconsultinggroup.comcontacti was unsure which email to use but i sourced that from her wordpress blogs about pagehttpskatpierson.wordpress.comabout her comment at the bottom suggests this should be fine im writing up something to send to her once i have it complete i will post it below for others to use.here is what i sent hergtdear katrina piersongti am contacting you on behalf of myself and the other 314000 users subscribed to reddits thedonald community. as you must know this subreddit is one of the central places that donald trumps fans followers and proponents can get together online without fear of backlash. we have held our own for a long time and have worked hard to contribute our high energy to donalds campaign so much so that reddits administrators have taken notice and begun to enact stringent policies which are only being enforced on our subreddit. this is nothing new our amazing community has been fending off whatever has been thrown at us thus far but weve reached a point where we are struggling to keep our heads above water.gtwe are turning to you because we need somebody supportive of us who has the political sway to stop our voices being silenced in these online communities. i trust you have heard of the recent scandal involving reddits ceo steve huffman aka uspez doctoring our users comments well spez is now doubling down and applying new rules to censor our posts from being visible on the front page of the website. in addition to this he and the other administrators are turning a blind eye to other users brigading and botting our posts to artificially lower their scores while simultaneously cracking down on thedonald for perceived slights and minor infractions. it is obvious now that reddit is choosing to strangle the life out of any opinions that conflict with the narrative they want to be pushing. if reddit were a smaller site this would be easier to justify however it is the 11th most visited website in the united states and the 25th most visted world wide. so what exactly are we proposing be done about itgtwhat we are requesting is for you and your team to get in touch with advance publications the business with the largest stake in reddit and their board of directors and lean on them to either remove steve huffman from his position or to stop him from censoring users that he personally disagrees with. we realize this is a lot to ask but were desperate and have no choice but to call in a favor before we lose our main haven for free speech. i dont know if this is fair to say but if we didnt have this place to discuss the issues correct fake news headlines investigate the wikileaks emails and share energy and positivity with one another donald trumps campaign would have had much more difficulty in this past election. we wish to maintain this community for the future as we have no doubt that our fight is far from over. all we want is to continue to have a safe haven in which to bolster and support our president elect but our community is having the life squeezed out of it and we have no one to turn to.gti believe i have said my piece now and i dont think this email needs to be any longer. please think about our plight and please see if there is anything that can be done to keep us from being censored before its too lategtpatriotically yours gtufoopacc i used my real name in the email gtmaga

donna shalalain a 1996 speech at the national childrens mental health initiative donna shalala secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services dhhs saidfrom fully immunizing children by age two... to stopping domestic violence were working to improve the lives of young people from the cradle to young adulthood. and a strong part of our vision is the mental health of children. we believe that mental health is just as important as physical health... maybe even more so....5as head of the dhhs shalala helped organize the national mental health services knowledge exchange network ken. ponder its definition for mental healthmental health refers to how a person thinks feels and acts when faced with lifes situations. it is how people look at themselves their lives and the other people in their lives ...and explore choices.6do you wonder what dr. shalala and her network of health planners would consider good thinking or bad thinking this definition doesnt tell us. how do they want people to look at themselves or explore choices the answer is clear when you study unescos psycho social strategies for conforming the minds of our children to its anti christian world view. but without this background information these ambiguous open ended phrases hide their intentions.we believe that mental health is just as important as physical health maybe even more so.donna shalaladepartment of health and human servicesisnt this sweet donna shalala likes to review lesbian books

thats because her comment was aimed at the president elects shameful actions. who do you think should be held to a higher standard the president elect or four thugs in chicago you guys are all pathetic. sad

i dont think that this will happen her dropping out. becoming president is her ultimate goal the globalist soros machine pumped so much money into her the dnc put so much money into her obama who hates her now campaigns for her and endorsed her. i dont want to see her dropping out honestly i want to see how trump rips her three new assholes during the debates. everything else would be boring then on her birthday wikileaks can drop da bomb.

honestly im not sure what we can do at this point theyre flooding anyone who is a trump supporter with downvotes in the 2a thread and upvoting their hivemind idiots and drama shills to the top. maybe this thread will get a sticky because theres no reason to post right now in any hot topic thread. it mirrors rpolitics.

theyve never had to face real opposition before. they thought they owned the internet the media the narratives the millennials ... moreover theyre quite used to the paul ryan mitch mcconnell gope types who will just roll over as soon as you whisper racisss. that sort of you owe me attitude and entitlement is set from the top crooked debbie wasserman schulzdnc. they dont know what to do or how to react when not just challenged but irrefutably proven to be incorrect andor lying.
shameful disclosure i voted for him in the primaries. a fool i was.
im pro choice...meaning i choose to be responsible beforehand. as in by not getting pregnant in the first place. birth control and the morning after pills are available at pharmacies throughout the country. i guess that makes me a responsible woman instead of a nasty one.

this is a huge insult in the arab world as the abu honorific is supposed to be for the eldest son. theyre insulting donald his two sons and ivanka by saying shes trying to fill the role of a man but still inferior to one.interesting side note the honorific isnt always based on your children. i was given the nickname abu kus though in reality im more abdul kus where as mega douchebag moqtada alsadr was known as abu atari.
already open investigations. trump is smartly staying away from it and letting the investigation play out so they cant diminish the results by claiming it was revenge. so no do not sign this. the less the administration talks about it the better it will be.
huffpoo is pure cancer.
darwin award jihadi goes to meet god. abdul never connect the battery unless the switch is turned off. hamas must be scrapping the bottom of the trash barrel if the top commanders are building their ieds. hey lets meme jihadis into a bomb making contest they might kill themselves all off. when on s really off its paradisejump in here peds lets build this bomb together

the bible says everything about the end of days and israel is of gods chosen people. whether you believe or not it is fundamentally that other nations and surrounding nations have been trying to destroy israel and taking their land. the five day war comes to mind in this regard.

trump is the true democratic candidate. he has adjusted his policies based on opinion even going so far as to crowdsource his debate prep and campaign positions from the people. he is the only candidate truly serving the american people.

wait a second did they actually get rid of the filibuster for good i vaguely heard something about that..harry reid is awful at 45d checkers. thats great for now also fucks moores opposition muvment.. but do you think that filibuster should come back
five more days ..
he really has no chance at a normal life unless the public was to really get behind him. i think he personally would of had to of been in the spotlight more so than wiki leaks the reason being is that if he becomes a name people can remember later its harder for him to get killed off. lets be real. its very unfortunate. this likely ends with ja in a body bag. he knew this too. its the sacrifice he made. for the people. i dont mean this literally but hes like the second jesus if youre religious. lmao. at this time the people dont even know how much he has done. depending on how things play out this could change things for a very long time. this man had a family he gave up for you. the least we can do is recognize that sacrifice and contribute that same passion to humanity and society.

hes dropping truth bombs and the audience is heavily reveling themselves as shills. hell be fine. there will be a lot of ole timey reagan republicans who will fight and die for the establishment but the younger crowd knows a lot about what trump is talking about. we know that george w was given a briefing on an imminent attack from osama a month before 911. we know that there were no wmds in iraq and it was a wasted military effort. the audience booing trump for saying these things will only strengthen our understanding in what we are up against. the system is against us. the system doesnt want us to know the truth. but most importantly the system bleeds and trump is the man holding the knife.
whats trumpss stance on dapl iirc i thought both he and hillary were for it.
